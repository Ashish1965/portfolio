          <p className="py-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-500">
            My journey into the world of web development began with a profound
            fascination for the intersection of design and code. Over the years,
            I've delved into the intricacies of both front-end and back-end
            development, finding joy in mastering languages and frameworks that
            power the web.

          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-500">
            On the front-end, I'm well-versed in HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript,
            utilizing modern frameworks like React , Next to create
            intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing interfaces. I'm
            passionate about user-centric design, ensuring seamless interactions
            and accessibility across devices. When it comes to the back-end, I
            thrive in architecting robust server-side solutions. I've worked
            extensively with Node.js, Express, Nextjs and various databases such as
            MongoDB, MySQL, building scalable and efficient
            applications.
